Inside of the 'employeeSQL' there are 3 files and one folder.

The 'table_schema' file is where you will find the code that I wrote to create the tables for this project.

The 'queries_schema' is where you will find the queries I wrote for the Data Analysis part of the project.

The 'ERD_image' file is a screenshot of the ERD diagram I created fore the project.

The folder titled 'data' is where you will find the six CSV files I imported into my tables.
